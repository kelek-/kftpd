This is a script I started to write with the thought of "diving deeper" into BASH and if it might be possible to solve such a rather complex problem like MP3 linking with a lot of conditions and possibilities with BASH.
Currently im providing this script "as is", so don't expect, that it works - it's more like a rough design of the software.

At the end of the development, this script should be able to:
- Link your MP3 files for following conditions:
    . alpha (A-Z)
    . year
    . language
    . mixtapes
    . singles
    . remixes
    . chopped and screwed
    . studios
    . publisher
    . source
    . genre
    . artist
    . album
    . group
- Validate symlinks and remove invalid ones

Thats "basically" all - this script will evolve with the time, but don't expect huge changes too earlier. I work on it, whenever I have the mood and the time todo so. :)

Sincerly,
